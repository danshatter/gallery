GALLERY

/* This is my third personal project. It is an image gallery that a user can upload their personal images, make certain images available for public viewing and could give his/her viewers opportunity to leave comments on the images. I used PHP OOP to build this from scratch. Styling isn't my thing as if now so it is not the best looking project. We grow everyday. Styling will definitely be my thing someday. */

1. import the 'gallery.sql' to get you started. Database name used here is 'gallery' but you are free to change it in 'credentials/secure.php'. You could put in your personal database credentials here as well

2. Go to 'core/init.php' and change the 'SITE_ROOT' relative to your server root. If the 'gallery' folder is inside your server root directly, '/gallery' would do just fine.

3. To get started, you need to sign up and login.

4. When you login in, follow the instructions on the rules for file uploading.

- Uploading multiple files is available.

- Posting comments and image downloading are also available in the user area. 

- For pagination, just change the argument of the Pagination instance on the 'index.php', 'photo.php' and 'list-photos.php' to your desired limit.

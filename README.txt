GALLERY

/* This is my third personal project. I used PHP OOP to build this from scratch. Its not the best looking site as regards to styling. I am more of a backend programmer, started delving into frontend. Hopefully with time, I would make it more presentable. */

1. import the 'gallery.sql' to get you started. Database name used here is 'gallery' but you are free to change it in 'credentials/secure.php'. You could put in your personal database credentials here as well

2. Go to 'core/init.php' and change the 'SITE_ROOT' relative to your server root. If the 'gallery' folder is inside your server root directly, '/gallery' would do just fine.

3. To get started, you need to sign up and login.

4. When you login in, follow the instructions on the rules for file uploading.

- Uploading multiple files is available.

- Posting comments and image downloading are also available.

- For pagination, just change the argument of the Pagination instance on the 'index.php', 'photo.php' and 'list-photos.php' to your desired limit.
